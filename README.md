**_What is a Telegram bot?_**

Bots are special programs that perform various functions and simplify the life of their users. Written for the Telegram platform, they are designed to perform a variety of functions: receiving news to searching for information and trading stocks.

For example, I have placed two bots. The first shows the current value of bitcoin, and the second shows small facts about me.

These bots were written using **JavaScript** and they live in **AWS**. If you want to try them, go to [Telegram](https://telegram.org/) and install a mobile or desktop app. After that you can find my bot use link [crypto_2022_Bot](https://t.me/crypto_2022_Bot).
